- `frontend/src/App.tsx` - Added Categories route
- `frontend/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx` - Added Categories to dropdown menu
- `frontend/src/types/dto/index.ts` - Export category types

**UI Improvements (per Andrea's feedback)**:
- ✅ Moved Categories link to top-right dropdown menu (not main sidebar)
- ✅ Applied ShopMefy green theme consistently throughout the page
- ✅ Removed unnecessary search functionality for cleaner UI
- ✅ Used ShopMefy branding colors (green) instead of generic colors
- ✅ Simplified interface focusing on essential functionality
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript import issues with proper DTO exports

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Full Category CRUD system implemented, tested, and UI optimized per requirements

**Database Content**:
- 8 Italian food categories seeded: Formaggi, Salumi, Pasta, Vini, Olio, Conserve, Dolci, Bevande
- 10 sample products linked to categories
- Agent functions working with category name mapping (Wine → Vini, Cheese → Formaggi, etc.)

### Task 26: Terraform Infrastructure Workflow (✅ COMPLETED)
**Description**: 
Created a complete Terraform infrastructure-as-code solution for deploying ShopMefy to AWS. The workflow provides automated infrastructure provisioning with VPC, EC2, RDS PostgreSQL, S3, and all necessary AWS resources for production deployment.

**Key Tasks**:
- ✅ Created comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/infra.yml`)
- ✅ Implemented complete Terraform configuration for AWS infrastructure
- ✅ Set up VPC with public/private subnets and proper networking
- ✅ Configured EC2 instance with pre-installed software stack (Node.js, PM2, Nginx)
- ✅ Set up RDS PostgreSQL with proper security and backup configuration
- ✅ Created S3 bucket for application deployments with versioning
- ✅ Implemented AWS Secrets Manager for database credentials
- ✅ Added IAM roles and security groups with least privilege access
- ✅ Created user data script for automatic software installation
- ✅ Added manual trigger with plan/apply/destroy options
- ✅ Implemented instance type selection (t3.micro/small/medium)
- ✅ Added comprehensive outputs with connection details
- ✅ Created documentation prompt for AI regeneration

**Technical Specifications**:
- **AWS Region**: us-east-1
- **Instance Types**: t3.micro/small/medium (scalable)
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL 15.4, db.t3.micro, 20GB storage
- **Storage**: S3 bucket with versioning for deployments
- **Security**: VPC with public/private subnets, security groups
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch basic logging
- **Estimated Cost**: ~$27-30/month for t3.micro setup

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Complete Terraform infrastructure workflow created
- ✅ AWS resources properly configured and secured
- ✅ EC2 instance pre-configured with required software
- ✅ Database credentials managed via AWS Secrets Manager
- ✅ S3 bucket ready for application deployments
- ✅ Manual workflow trigger with multiple options
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and prompts created
- ✅ Cost-effective production-ready infrastructure

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Ready for production deployment

**Files Created**:
- `.github/workflows/infra.yml` - Complete infrastructure workflow
- `finalproject-AG/others/infra-workflow-prompt.md` - AI regeneration prompt

### Task 27: Application Deployment Workflow (✅ COMPLETED)
**Description**: 
Created a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow for deploying the ShopMefy application to AWS EC2. The workflow handles building both backend and frontend, uploading to S3, and triggering automated deployment on the EC2 instance with health checks and monitoring.

**Key Tasks**:
- ✅ Created complete deployment workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- ✅ Implemented Node.js 20 setup with npm caching optimization
- ✅ Added backend and frontend build processes
- ✅ Configured S3 sync with proper file exclusions
- ✅ Implemented SSH connection to EC2 instance
- ✅ Added systemd service integration for automated deployment
- ✅ Created comprehensive health checks (PM2, Nginx, API health)
- ✅ Added deployment summary with access URLs
- ✅ Implemented error handling and status reporting
- ✅ Added manual trigger with environment selection
- ✅ Created documentation prompt for AI regeneration

**Workflow Features**:
- **Build Optimization**: Excludes node_modules, .git, logs, .env from S3 upload
- **Health Checks**: Verifies PM2 processes, Nginx status, /api/health endpoint
- **Service Management**: Uses pre-configured shopmefy-deploy systemd service
- **Environment Support**: Production and staging deployment targets
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Deployment status, service health, access URLs

**Integration**:
- **Compatible with Terraform**: Uses S3 bucket created by infrastructure workflow
- **EC2 Integration**: Works with pre-configured shopme user and software stack
- **Database Connection**: Uses AWS Secrets Manager credentials
- **Service Management**: Automatic PM2 and Nginx service verification

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ Complete deployment workflow created
- ✅ Backend and frontend builds working
- ✅ S3 upload with proper file filtering
- ✅ SSH deployment automation functional
- ✅ Health checks comprehensive and reliable
- ✅ Error handling and status reporting
- ✅ Manual trigger with environment options
- ✅ Documentation and prompts created

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Ready for production deployment

**Files Created**:
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - Complete deployment workflow
- `finalproject-AG/others/deploy-workflow-prompt.md` - AI regeneration prompt

**Deployment Process**:
1. Run `infra.yml` workflow to create AWS infrastructure
2. Configure GitHub secrets with AWS credentials and SSH keys
3. Run `deploy.yml` workflow to deploy application
4. Access application via provided URLs
