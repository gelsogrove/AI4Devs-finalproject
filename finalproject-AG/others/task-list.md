**Description**: 
Fixed issue where the debug mode in the frontend was not showing function calls even when they were being executed correctly by the backend. The debug panel was showing "No function calls recorded yet" despite functions being called successfully.

**Issue Identified**: 
The frontend was only capturing debug information from the backend response when debug mode was already active at the time of sending the message. This meant that if a user activated debug mode after sending a message, they wouldn't see the function call information.

**Key Tasks**:
- ✅ Analyze debug mode implementation in `frontend/src/pages/Chatbot.tsx`
- ✅ Identify the conditional logic issue in debug info capture
- ✅ Modify debug capture to always store backend debug information
- ✅ Test that function calls are now visible when debug mode is activated
- ✅ Verify backend is correctly calling functions (e.g., `getDocuments` for NAFTA question)

**Technical Changes**:
- **Modified**: `frontend/src/pages/Chatbot.tsx` - Changed debug capture condition from `if (response.debug && debugMode)` to `if (response.debug)` to always capture debug information
- **Result**: Debug mode now shows function calls regardless of when it's activated

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Backend correctly calls `getDocuments` for "International Transportation Law what is NAFTA?" question
- ✅ Frontend now captures debug information from all backend responses
- ✅ Debug mode displays function calls when activated after message is sent
- ✅ Debug panel shows function name, arguments, results, and processing time
