## 📄 Document Management System

### ✅ Document Delete Functionality Fix (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Date**: 2025-05-29
- **Description**: Fixed document deletion functionality to actually delete records from database instead of mock responses

#### What was implemented:

1. **Backend Delete Implementation** ✅:
   - Updated `deleteDocument` method in `SimpleDocumentController` to perform real database operations
   - Added proper document existence check before deletion
   - Implemented cascade deletion of related `documentChunk` records to handle foreign key constraints
   - Added proper error handling for Prisma P2025 (record not found) errors
   - Added logging for successful deletions with document details

2. **Database Integration** ✅:
   - Replaced mock static data with real Prisma database queries
   - Updated `getDocumentById` method to fetch from database instead of static objects
   - Enhanced `getDocumentStats` method to calculate real statistics from database
   - Proper handling of document relationships and constraints

3. **API Testing** ✅:
   - Verified DELETE `/api/documents/:id` endpoint works correctly
   - Tested document existence validation (404 for non-existent documents)
   - Confirmed cascade deletion of related document chunks
   - Validated proper JSON responses and error messages

#### Technical Details:

**Delete Method Implementation**:
```typescript
deleteDocument = async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    const { id } = req.params;
    
    // Check if document exists
    const document = await prisma.document.findUnique({
      where: { id }
    });
    
    if (!document) {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Document not found' });
    }

    // Delete related document chunks first (due to foreign key constraint)
    await prisma.documentChunk.deleteMany({
      where: { documentId: id }
    });

    // Delete the document
    await prisma.document.delete({
      where: { id }
    });

    logger.info(`Document deleted successfully: ${document.originalName} (ID: ${id})`);
    res.json({ message: 'Document deleted successfully' });
  } catch (error: any) {
    logger.error('Error deleting document:', error);
    if (error.code === 'P2025') {
      return res.status(404).json({ error: 'Document not found' });
    }
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Failed to delete document' });
  }
};
```

**Database Integration Improvements**:
- `getDocumentById`: Now fetches real documents from database
- `getDocumentStats`: Calculates real statistics (count, size, status breakdown)
- Proper error handling for all database operations

#### Files Modified:
- `backend/src/controllers/document.controller.simple.ts` - Complete delete functionality implementation

#### Testing Results:
- ✅ Successfully deleted document with ID `e8c716f1-3de0-4dcd-8f9d-cd29c73a760b`
- ✅ Document count reduced from 3 to 2 documents in database
- ✅ Proper JSON response: `{"message":"Document deleted successfully"}`
- ✅ Related document chunks properly cleaned up
- ✅ Frontend delete button now works correctly with real database operations

#### User Experience Impact:
- ✅ **Functional Delete**: Users can now actually delete documents from the system
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Proper cascade deletion maintains database consistency
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid document IDs
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Document list updates immediately after deletion
- ✅ **Logging**: System administrators can track document deletions in logs

**Resolution**: Document deletion functionality now works correctly with real database operations, replacing the previous mock implementation that only returned success messages without actually deleting records.

### ✅ Document Upload Functionality Implementation (COMPLETED)
- **Status**: ✅ COMPLETED
- **Date**: 2025-05-29

4. **Enhanced Delete Functionality** ✅:
   - Physical file deletion from filesystem when database record is deleted
   - Proper error handling for file system operations
   - Cleanup logging and warning messages for failed file deletions

#### Technical Implementation:

**Multer Storage Configuration**:
```typescript
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
  destination: (req, file, cb) => {
    cb(null, uploadDir);
  },
  filename: (req, file, cb) => {
    const uniqueSuffix = Date.now() + '-' + Math.round(Math.random() * 1E9);
    const sanitizedName = file.originalname.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9.-]/g, '-').toLowerCase();
    cb(null, `${uniqueSuffix}-${sanitizedName}`);
  }
});
```

**Upload Method Enhancement**:
```typescript
uploadDocument = [
  upload.single('document'),
  async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
    // Real file processing with database integration
    const document = await prisma.document.create({
      data: {
        filename: req.file.filename,
        originalName: req.file.originalname,
        title: title || req.file.originalname.replace('.pdf', ''),
        mimeType: req.file.mimetype,
        size: req.file.size,
        uploadPath: req.file.path,
        status: 'COMPLETED'
      }
    });
  }
];
```

**File System Integration**:
- Automatic directory creation: `backend/uploads/documents/`
- Unique filename generation: `timestamp-random-sanitized-name.pdf`
- File access URL: `http://localhost:8080/uploads/documents/filename.pdf`

#### Files Modified:

> **Note:** The `tags` field has been removed as per client request.

## Environment Variables (.env)

### Structure
- There will be **two separate `.env` files**:
  - One for the backend (e.g., `/backend/.env`)
  - One for the frontend (e.g., `/frontend/.env`)
 

### Backend `.env` Variables
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/shopme"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"
JWT_EXPIRATION="24h"

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Server
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV="development"
API_PREFIX="/api"  # All routes will be prefixed with /api

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"

# Chat History
CHAT_HISTORY_TTL="1h"  # How long to keep chat history in memory
```

### Frontend `.env` Variables
```env
# API
API_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # Used for all API calls
API_PREFIX="/api"                # Used in both dev and prod

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_CHAT_PERSISTENCE=true
ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE=false

# Analytics (if needed)
ANALYTICS_ID=""
```

### API Structure Note
All backend routes will be prefixed with `/api`:
- Authentication: `/api/auth/*`
- Products: `/api/products/*`
- FAQs: `/api/faqs/*`
- Chat: `/api/chat/*`
- Agent Config: `/api/agent/*`

In development:
- Frontend runs on `localhost:5173`
- Backend runs on `localhost:3000`
- Vite proxy forwards all `/api/*` requests to backend

### Security Notes
- Never commit real secrets to the repository
- Only commit `.env.example` files
- All sensitive operations must happen in the backend
- Frontend env vars are public - never put secrets there

## Context & Rationale

This document details the step-by-step tasks for building the ShopMe MVP within a 30-hour timeframe. The goal is to deliver a functional, testable, and visually appealing demo of a WhatsApp e-commerce platform, focusing strictly on essential features. The UI will use a clean white and green theme and must be fully responsive for both mobile and desktop.

avremo dopo il login una splashpage che spiega a grandi linee il progetto e che in questo caso facciamo 
Vedere come useremo le call function in un chatbot

### Objective
Build a production-ready MVP for ShopMe, demonstrating:
- User login (JWT, no roles/permissions)
- Product CRUD (API + UI)
- Dynamic AI Agent configuration (temperature, top_p, top_k, maxTokens, prompt)
- Chatbot (answers questions, shows product list, uses function calling)
- Testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Deployment (EC2 + Nginx)
- Documentation (Swagger, README, seed script)

### Key Constraints & Best Practices
- **No user roles:** Only basic authentication, no role/permission logic.
- **Responsiveness:** All UI must be mobile and desktop friendly.
- **Accessibility:** Color contrast, focus states, labels, and basic usability.
- **UI/UX:** White/green theme, simple wireframes, clear flows.
- **Data from DB:** All data fetched from the database must be post-processed (e.g., price formatting, image URLs, description cleanup) before being shown in the UI or chatbot.
- **MVP focus:** Only essential features, no unnecessary refactors or extras.
- **Security:** JWT, basic rate limiting, no sensitive data in clear text.
- **Chat history is managed on the server:** The server maintains the conversation memory, so the frontend only sends the new message. This avoids sending the full chat history from the frontend each time, improving efficiency and privacy.

### Dynamic Agent Configuration (OpenRouter-style)
The agent (chatbot) configuration is dynamically adjustable at runtime, similar to OpenRouter. Parameters (temperature, top_p, maxTokens, prompt) can be set and updated via UI/API, and the chatbot must always use the latest config for its responses—no backend restart required.

### Chatbot Function Calling & Product List
The chatbot must support function calling: when a user requests the product list, it triggers a backend function to fetch products from the DB, which are then post-processed and formatted for user-friendly display in chat.

### Data Post-Processing
All data from the DB (especially product lists) must be mapped, formatted, and cleaned before being sent to the frontend or chatbot.

### Roadmap (MVP Steps)
1. Project setup (repo, env, lint, backend/frontend base)
2. UI/UX design (wireframes, palette, base components, share compoenents)
3. Auth (User model, login API/UI, no roles)
4. Product CRUD (API + UI)
5. AgentConfig (API + UI)
6. Chatbot (UI + backend, function calling, config compliance)
7. Testing (unit, integration, E2E)
8. Documentation & Swagger
9. Deploy (EC2/Nginx)
10. Final polish & QA

## 6. Chatbot (Conversational UI & OpenAI Integration)
- [x] Chat UI (input, bubbles, loading, responsive)
- [x] Backend chat endpoint (`POST /api/chat`)
- [x] Integrate with real OpenAI API (use agent config params)
- [x] Implement function calling:
    - [x] IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS ON FUNCTION CALLING:
        - The chatbot implements READ operations via these functions:

            2. getProductDetails (by productId)
            3. searchProducts (by query string)
            4. getFAQs (all or by category)
            5. searchFAQs (by query string)
        - The LLM (not the backend) decides when to call these functions
        - Function call flow:
            1. User sends message
            2. Backend sends message + function schemas to LLM
            3. LLM decides if/which function to call
            4. Backend executes function (DB query)
            5. Results sent back to LLM for natural language response
    - [x] Parse prompt, detect when DB data is needed
    - [x] Build and validate SELECT query (fields, where, limit)
    - [x] Execute query, post-process data
    - [x] Return data to LLM, let LLM format the final response
    - [x] Return formatted response to user
    - [x] All logic must be clearly documented and easily extensible for future function calls
- [x] (Optional) Persist chat history (Conversation/Message)
- [x] Add support for multilingual queries (Italian):
