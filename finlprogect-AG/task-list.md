## Data Model

### Product
```prisma
model Product {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  name        String
  description String
  price       Decimal  @db.Decimal(10, 2)

## Environment Variables (.env)

### Structure
- There will be **two separate `.env` files**:
  - One for the backend (e.g., `/backend/.env`)
  - One for the frontend (e.g., `/frontend/.env`)
 

### Backend `.env` Variables
```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/shopme"

# Authentication
JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"
JWT_EXPIRATION="24h"

# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Server
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV="development"
API_PREFIX="/api"  # All routes will be prefixed with /api

# Frontend URL (for CORS)
FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"

# Chat History
CHAT_HISTORY_TTL="1h"  # How long to keep chat history in memory
```

### Frontend `.env` Variables
```env
# API
API_URL="http://localhost:3000"  # Used for all API calls
API_PREFIX="/api"                # Used in both dev and prod

# Feature Flags
ENABLE_CHAT_PERSISTENCE=true
ENABLE_DEBUG_MODE=false

# Analytics (if needed)
ANALYTICS_ID=""
```

### API Structure Note
All backend routes will be prefixed with `/api`:
- Authentication: `/api/auth/*`
- Products: `/api/products/*`
- FAQs: `/api/faqs/*`
- Chat: `/api/chat/*`
- Agent Config: `/api/agent/*`

In development:
- Frontend runs on `localhost:5173`
- Backend runs on `localhost:3000`
- Vite proxy forwards all `/api/*` requests to backend

### Security Notes
- Never commit real secrets to the repository
- Only commit `.env.example` files
- All sensitive operations must happen in the backend
- Frontend env vars are public - never put secrets there

## Context & Rationale

This document details the step-by-step tasks for building the ShopMe MVP within a 30-hour timeframe. The goal is to deliver a functional, testable, and visually appealing demo of a WhatsApp e-commerce platform, focusing strictly on essential features. The UI will use a clean white and green theme and must be fully responsive for both mobile and desktop.

avremo dopo il login una splashpage che spiega a grandi linee il progetto e che in questo caso facciamo 
Vedere come useremo le call function in un chatbot

### Objective
Build a production-ready MVP for ShopMe, demonstrating:
- User login (JWT, no roles/permissions)
- Product CRUD (API + UI)
- Dynamic AI Agent configuration (temperature, top_p, top_k, maxTokens, prompt)
- Chatbot (answers questions, shows product list, uses function calling)
- Testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Deployment (EC2 + Nginx)
- Documentation (Swagger, README, seed script)

### Key Constraints & Best Practices
- **No user roles:** Only basic authentication, no role/permission logic.
- **Responsiveness:** All UI must be mobile and desktop friendly.
- **Accessibility:** Color contrast, focus states, labels, and basic usability.
- **UI/UX:** White/green theme, simple wireframes, clear flows.
- **Data from DB:** All data fetched from the database must be post-processed (e.g., price formatting, image URLs, description cleanup) before being shown in the UI or chatbot.
- **MVP focus:** Only essential features, no unnecessary refactors or extras.
- **Security:** JWT, basic rate limiting, no sensitive data in clear text.
- **Chat history is managed on the server:** The server maintains the conversation memory, so the frontend only sends the new message. This avoids sending the full chat history from the frontend each time, improving efficiency and privacy.

### Dynamic Agent Configuration (OpenRouter-style)
The agent (chatbot) configuration is dynamically adjustable at runtime, similar to OpenRouter. Parameters (temperature, top_p, maxTokens, prompt) can be set and updated via UI/API, and the chatbot must always use the latest config for its responses—no backend restart required.

### Chatbot Function Calling & Product List
The chatbot must support function calling: when a user requests the product list, it triggers a backend function to fetch products from the DB, which are then post-processed and formatted for user-friendly display in chat.

### Data Post-Processing
All data from the DB (especially product lists) must be mapped, formatted, and cleaned before being sent to the frontend or chatbot.

### Roadmap (MVP Steps)
1. Project setup (repo, env, lint, backend/frontend base)
2. UI/UX design (wireframes, palette, base components, share compoenents)
3. Auth (User model, login API/UI, no roles)
4. Product CRUD (API + UI)
5. AgentConfig (API + UI)
6. Chatbot (UI + backend, function calling, config compliance)
7. Testing (unit, integration, E2E)
8. Documentation & Swagger
9. Deploy (EC2/Nginx)
10. Final polish & QA

## 6. Chatbot (Conversational UI & OpenAI Integration)
- [x] Chat UI (input, bubbles, loading, responsive)
- [x] Backend chat endpoint (`POST /api/chat`)
- [x] Integrate with real OpenAI API (use agent config params)
- [x] Implement function calling:
    - [x] IMPORTANT CLARIFICATIONS ON FUNCTION CALLING:
        - The chatbot implements READ operations via these functions:
            1. getProductList (pagination, filters by category/price)
            2. getProductDetails (by productId)
            3. searchProducts (by query string)
            4. getFAQs (all or by category)
            5. searchFAQs (by query string)
        - The LLM (not the backend) decides when to call these functions
        - Function call flow:
            1. User sends message
            2. Backend sends message + function schemas to LLM
            3. LLM decides if/which function to call
            4. Backend executes function (DB query)
            5. Results sent back to LLM for natural language response
    - [x] Parse prompt, detect when DB data is needed

     - `sanitize-filename` for secure file naming
     - `file-type` for file validation
   - ✅ Updated TypeScript types and configurations

#### Technical Implementation Details:

**Storage Configuration**:
```typescript
// Development: Local filesystem
UPLOAD_DIR=uploads/documents

// Production: AWS S3
AWS_S3_BUCKET=my-s3-bucket
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-aws-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-aws-secret-key
AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
```

**Document Processing Flow**:
1. File upload → Validation → Storage (Local/S3)
2. PDF text extraction → Chunking → Embedding generation
3. Database storage → Search indexing → Chatbot integration

**Security Features**:
- ✅ File type validation (PDF only)
- ✅ File size limits (10MB max)
- ✅ Filename sanitization
- ✅ S3 server-side encryption
- ✅ Access control and user isolation

#### Database Schema:
```sql
-- Documents table
CREATE TABLE documents (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  originalName TEXT NOT NULL,
  mimeType TEXT NOT NULL,
  size INTEGER NOT NULL,
  uploadPath TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'PROCESSING',
  userId TEXT,
  metadata TEXT, -- JSON
  createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Document chunks table
CREATE TABLE document_chunks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  content TEXT NOT NULL,
  pageNumber INTEGER,
  chunkIndex INTEGER NOT NULL,
  documentId TEXT NOT NULL,
  embedding TEXT, -- JSON array
  createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (documentId) REFERENCES documents(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

#### Benefits Achieved:
