# Cursor Rules for AI4Devs Final Project

## üß† Core Development Rules

* Focus **only** on code areas **relevant to the assigned task**.
* **DO NOT INVENT** anything outside of the assigned scope.
* **Keep solutions simple** and avoid unnecessary complexity.
* All code and comments must be **in English**.
* **NEVER** run `git push` ‚Äî **only Andrea** can do this.
* Use **PostgreSQL** (not SQLite).
* **OPENROUTER_API_KEY** is stored in the `.env` file of the backend (DO NOT TOUCH `.env`).
* All **scripts** must be placed inside the `/script` folder.
* Address me **by name (Andrea)** in chats and discussions (e.g., "Hello Andrea", "Andrea, what do you think?").
* Maintain the existing **graphics and layout**; DO NOT make changes unless **explicit permission** is granted.

## ‚ùå Strict Prohibitions - What Never to Do

### üö´ NEVER HARDCODE DATA

* **NEVER** create hardcoded responses or fallback data in controllers.
* **NEVER** return fake/mock data outside of test environments.
* **NEVER** use hardcoded product lists, prices, or inventory data.
* **NEVER** create static responses that bypass database queries.
* **ALWAYS** use dynamic database searches and fetch real data from **Prisma**.
* **NO** static text, prompts, or codes; **everything must come from the database**.

### üö´ Additional Restrictions

* DO NOT write any **catch blocks** with generic messages; **always provide the full error stack**.
* **NEVER create fake functions** ‚Äì everything must reflect the real database and logic.
* **NEVER change the layout or graphics** without my **explicit permission**.
* **Update** the `task-list.md` inside `/finlprogect-AG` whenever a new task is completed.

## üìö Notes

* The user's input is processed by the **first LLM** (which decides the target calling function), and the **second LLM** (which has history) formats the final user response.
  * This is the **only static point** in the workflow.
  * If the flow **does not follow** this structure, we must discuss it or **modify the agent's prompt** inside the **SEED**.
  * don't create package.json in root use backend or frontend folders for install packages
  * DONT' CREATE ANYYTHING IN ROOT use temp or use `/finlprogect-AG`
